    "    \"The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India. Founded by the BCCI (the Board of Control for Cricket in India) in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise teams.[3][4] The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5]. The IPL is by far the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues have been established.[a][11][12][13] In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[14] According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.[15] In December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting firm D and P Advisory.[16] Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event on the internet, with 32 million viewers\"\n",

    "    \"The International Cricket Council (ICC) is the global governing body of cricket. It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from Australia, England, and South Africa. It was renamed as the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and adopted its current name in 1987. The ICC has its headquarters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.The ICC currently has 108 member nations: 12 Full Members that play Test matches, and 96 Associate Members.[3] The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, most notably the Cricket World Cup, T20 World Cup, and ICC World Test Championship. It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, One Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. It promulgates the ICC Code of Conduct, which sets professional standards of discipline for international cricket,[4] and also co-ordinates action against corruption and match-fixing through its Anti-Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU).The ICC does not control bilateral fixtures between member countries (which include all Test matches outside of the World Test Championship Final), and neither does it govern domestic cricket within member countries. It does not make or alter the laws of the game, which have remained under the governance of the Marylebone Cricket Club since 1788.[5].The Chairman heads the board of directors and on June 26, 2014, Narayanaswami Srinivasan, the former president of BCCI, was announced as the first chairman of the council.[6] The role of ICC president became a largely honorary position after the establishment of the chairman role and other changes made to the ICC constitution in 2014. It has been claimed that the 2014 changes have handed control to the 'Big Three' nations of England, India and Australia.[7] The last ICC president was Zaheer Abbas,[8] who was appointed in June 2015 following the resignation of Mustafa Kamal in April 2015. When the post of ICC president was abolished in April 2016, Shashank Manohar, who replaced Srinivasan in October 2015, became the first independent elected chairman of the ICC.\"\n",

    "    \"Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is the national governing body of cricket in India. Its headquarters is situated at the cricket centre in Churchgate, Mumbai. The BCCI is the wealthiest governing body of cricket in the world.The BCCI was established in 1 December 1928 at Madras (currently Chennai) under Act XXI of 1860 of Madras and was subsequently reregistered under the Tamil Nadu Societies Registration Act, 1975.[17] It is a consortium of state cricket associations that select their own representatives who elect the BCCI president. It joined the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1926 which later became the International Cricket Council.[2] The BCCI is an autonomous, Government organization that does fall under the purview of the National Sports Federation of India of Government of India and does not receive any grants from the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. The BCCI is influential in international cricket. The International Cricket Council shares the largest part of its revenue with the BCCI. IPL run by BCCI is one of the wealthiest sports leagues in the world.In financial year 2023-2024, BCCI earned ₹16,875 crore (US$2.0 billion).[21] BCCI paid ₹4,000 crore (US$480 million) in taxes for the financial year 2022-23.R. E. Grant Govan was the first BCCI president and Anthony De Mello was its first secretary.[23] As of February 2023, Roger Binny is the incumbent BCCI president and Jay Shah is secretary.BCCI has hosted multiple Cricket World Cups,[a] and will host the 2026 T20 World Cup, the 2029 Champions Trophy, the 2031 Cricket World Cup,[b] and the 2025 Women's Cricket World Cup.[27].The BCCI manages four squads that represent India in international cricket; the men's national cricket team, the women's national cricket team, the men's national under-19 cricket team and women's national under-19 cricket team. It also governs developmental India A, India B and India A women's teams.[28] Its national selection committee, which is led by chief national selector, selects players for these teams.[d] As part of its duties, the BCCI organises and schedules matches to be played by each of these teams, and schedules, sanctions and organises domestic cricket in India.\"\n",
